# Brain-Tumour-Detection-using-Transfer-Learning
This is my M.Tech project which is part of the subject introduction to deep learning. The goal of this project is to leverage the maximum power of pre-trained models like ResNet (Residual Network), Xception, U-Net etc. for the detection of brain tumour.
